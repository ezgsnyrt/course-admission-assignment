                <div class="section-content">
                    <p> Having a background in education and transitioning into the IT sector, particularly web development,
                        I am eager to build on my existing knowledge by gaining expertise in back-end development and becoming a proficient full-stack
                        developer. My recent completion of a front-end development course which provided me with a solid foundation for HTML, CSS,
                        JavaScript, and frameworks like React has motivated me to study this course. However, to become a proficient full-stack developer,
                        I need to complement this knowledge with back-end skills. This course will enable me to contribute effectively to all phases of

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p> Having spent many years as an academic and recently completing a front-end developer course, I believe I have a strong foundation
                        to become a good future developer. My academic background has instilled me with important skills aligning well with the necessary
                        qualifications required for web developers. Firstly, I am accustomed to seeking out new knowledge, staying updated with the latest
                        developments in the field, and implementing new technologies and methodologies into my daily practices. As a developer, I believe
                        this mindset will help me keep pace with the ever-evolving innovations in the web development sector by learning more. Secondly,
                        I am experienced in delving deeper into vast amounts of information to solve complex problems, which in turn provides me with
                        evaluating multiple data sources, finding the reliable information and synthesize information to create a functional solution. I
                        believe that it is helpful skill for me to use in web development where I’ll encounter various challenges that require innovative
                        solutions. Thirdly, I’ve had unique experiences to work on tasks which require both creative and analytical thinking. I am good at
                        envisioning innovative solutions by breaking down complex problems, understanding system dynamics, identifying components and realizing
                        patterns in data structure. Fourthly, I am confident in my ability to zoom-in on specific details of a problem and zoom-out to see the
                        bigger picture. I believe these skills enable me to effectively navigate between different levels of abstraction in web development. This
                        involves understanding micro-level details of code implementation and macro-level aspects of projects.

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p> I have completed the front-end development course provided by Sundsgården Folkhögskola. It helped me have an in-depth understanding of
                        key web development technologies. It also offered a learning environment where I can practice different components interactively to create
                        dynamic webpages. Throughout the course, I gained proficiency in structuring web content effectively and styling web pages to create visually
                        appealing layouts using HTML and CSS. In regard to write more maintainable and efficient stylesheets, I also learnt and effectively used SASS
                        in my projects. The curriculum also encouraged to me to effectively build responsive websites by means of responsive design and Bootstrap. I
                        also learnt adding interactivity and dynamic content to websites by delving into JavaScript together with React library and helped me develop
                        dynamic and efficient user interfaces. I simultaneously followed several online platforms in order to have a better understanding of each
                        curriculum content. I had a chance to practice each course content with small-scale assignments as well as with some additional personal projects.
                        In line with the course content, I learnt and used different project management methodologies like Agile and Kanban in group projects. For
                        instance, in our last group project we used Kanban and created an API trivia quiz game by utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. It was an
                        unbelievable learning experience for me in that I had the chance to integrate different technologies, manage project tasks efficiently with Kanban,
                        collaborate effectively with my team, applying technical skills in a practical setting, and using Github actively.

                    <p><br>To whom it may concern,<br>
                        <span> I am writing to express my strong interest in the 'IT - Back-End Developer' course provided by Sundsgården Folkhögskola.
                            Having a background in the field of education at Middle East Technical University in Turkey and a passion for developing my
                            qualifications to be a good future developer, I am excited to take a further step to pursue a career in web development. Having
                            previously completed the 'IT - Front-End Developer' course at Sundsgården Folkhögskola, I am eager to continue expanding my
                            competencies in this field and contribute to my new community here in Sweden.
                        </span>
                        <span>Throughout my academic journey, I have worn the hats of teaching and research assistantship in education. My educational
                            background, together with my professional life, equipped me with diverse skills and experiences that I believe will be an asset
                            in pursuing a career as a web developer. As a graduate student with M.S. degree, I had significant opportunities to develop my
                            academic skills. I’ve provided all kinds of support for instructors to deliver various courses, which in turn immensely affected
                            my professional skills. Moreover, I’ve had important opportunities to develop my research skills by embarking on my independent
                            thesis, working collaboratively in research projects, presenting findings at conferences, and publishing articles on several
                            subjects. These experiences have involved me in developing my researcher identity, transforming myself into a knowledge producer,
                            becoming a self-directed learner and collaborative team member, staying at the forefront of technological advancements, and creating
                            a shared value at work. I believe these qualifications contributed meaningfully to my strengths and built a bridge between my academic
                            foundation and the needs of the web developer job market.
                        </span>
                        <span>My close circle of friends, many of whom are back-end developers, was another motivator for me to pursue a career in web development.
                            Witnessing their work routines, methodologies and mindset has triggered my interest in web development. Having spent plenty of time with
                            my developer friends has provided me with having a clear understanding of the challenges they face, ways of thinking developers use, the
                            ways of finding solutions to overcome those challenges, and of course the necessary skills needed to be a qualified developer. Upon
                            reflection, I’ve come to realize the significant overlap between the qualifications required for a developer and my personal characteristics
                            cultivated over years in academia. It also made me think that I could actually become a good web developer and I have nothing to lose to try
                            it. These exciting observations together with this awareness boosted my curiosity for being a developer in the near future.
                        </span>
                        <span>I quit my job at the university and moved to Sweden with my husband last year. This was turning point in my life in that I started to follow
                            my passion and think web development as a professional career. I registered to the 'IT - Front-End Developer' course which has made amazing
                            contributions to my understanding and conceptualization of front-end development. It enabled me to lay a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                            React, Bootstrap, SASS, GitHub and many more. My personal efforts together with the course, equiped me with essential technical skills and gave me
                            the confidence to strive further in this journey. I had chances of working on my individual projects as well as two group projects aligning with
                            the curriculum of the course. Each made important contributions to my existing knowledge of web development. This course also increased my curiosity
                            about learning what is going on where I cannot see on a website. Thus, I am highly motivated to have an understanding of back-end development processes
                            and its dynamic interaction with front-end components.
                        </span>
                        <span>I feel sure that this course will significantly contribute to my career advancement as a web developer. I wholeheartedly believe that my skill
                            set together with my experiences with the front-end web development will enable me to succeed in the back-end developer course. It is my sincere hope
                            that this course will be also beneficial for me to contribute substantially to the sector, to make significant impacts for the local community in Sweden
                            in the future, as well as to adapt to this community within that time.

                                    <h1>Project Description and Code Explanation</h1>
                                    <p>This projects aims to create a rock, paper, scissors game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript together with React.
                                    I started developing the game by creating the React project. After that, I wrote the basic HTML and CSS codes
                                    which enabled me to prepare the initial structure of the game. I also helped me monitor and follow the changes
                                    simultaneously. Then, I integrated JavaScript into my existing codes.</p>
                                    <p>This project basically has two components. The first component is the App.js which involves all the variable
                                    definitions, functions and HTML contents. This compont has an ‘actions’ object which defines the rules of the
                                    game and indicates which action beats which one. Also, there is a function for random actions which select
                                    actions randomly from the actions object. Herein, there is another function which compares the player’s and
                                    the computer’s actions and reflect the result on the score board. Another function included in this component
                                    is ActionIcon which renders the proper icon based on the given action. I’ve also included another function which
                                    displays the player’s or the computer’s score and their current action. In order for the player to take an action,
                                    the game includes a button action function which lets the player select an action. When clicked on the action button,
                                    it calls another function with the selected action. Moreover, this component includes a function which calls a
                                    text about the result of each turn: whether it’s a tie, the player wins, or the computer wins. Besides, the App
                                    function is the backbone of the game which contains the game logic. It maintains the state for the player’s and
                                    computer’s actions, their scores, and the game result basically. It also helps handle the player’s action, generates
                                    a random action for the computer and calculates the winner, and updates the score board. It also includes the reset
                                    button which enables the player to reset the player’s and computer’s score when clicked on this button. </p>
                                    <p>The second main component is the Modal created for allowing the players learn the game rules. This component includes
                                    a state variable to control when the modal will be visible. For instance, the state variable ‘modal’ is set to false,
                                    resulting in not showing the modal at the start. Corresponsingly, in the modal, there is also a ‘game rules’ button which
                                    triggers a toggle function to change the visibilty of the modal. When the player clicks on the button, modal functions
                                    becomes true. Consequently, a modal window with its content is rendered. On the other hand, when the player clicks on the
                                    ‘close’ button inside the modal, the toggle modal function is called again and the modal disappears.</p>
                                    <p>In addition to the aforementioned features, I incorporated media queries into the project in order to make it responsive
                                    in terms of design. I mean it is expected to be played in small, medium and large sized devices with the help of the adaptive
                                    design of the game content.</p>
